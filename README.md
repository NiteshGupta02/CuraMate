# CuraMate

CuraMate – Your Personalized Ayurvedic Health Assistant – is an innovative project that integrates the principles of traditional Ayurveda with modern artificial intelligence to promote holistic well-being. The system allows users to input their physical or emotional symptoms, which are then analyzed using machine learning algorithms trained on Ayurvedic data. Based on the user's input and their body type (dosha – Vata, Pitta, Kapha), CuraMate provides customized herbal remedies, dietary suggestions, and lifestyle changes rooted in Ayurvedic principles.
